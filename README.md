# UniCrossed

Imagine a website that connects both students and content. We present you, UniCrossed. It is a study site designed for university students that struggle with either meeting new people and understanding the contents of their university, sometimes even both. Made using Python, with Django as the framework for both backend and frontend, along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
